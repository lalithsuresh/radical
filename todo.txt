Todo for Radical

- Persistant storage of calendar
  - de/serialise to bytes
- Calendar maintains a number of lists, one for each state of slot
  - free only if not in any of above lists
- Cache/store messages sent
- What happens if you cannot deliver a message 
  - error messages? 
  - how long do we wait? do we have to wait? live without timeouts

- Lookup for batch users
- prevent registering restricted name
- method synchronization and blocking calls
- fix recv msg type in client (connect ACKs)
- Better way to ack disconnect msgs
- check return type for lookup response

Puppet master
- add PuppetServiceClient to client project
- PuppetMaster has two services: PuppetMasterService and StatisticsService (for evaluation purposes of the protocol)

Dirty items in Remoting
- Not possible to send from a remoting call... so called remoting loops
-- Basically a remote call is triggered from a remote call. The channel will be locked. 

- The only thing which can change a GUI is the thread which created it. Solution: 
 
public delegate void DelegateAddMessage(string nick, string msg);
Form1.Invoke(new DelegateAddMessage(Form1.AddMsg), new Object[] { nick, msg });
