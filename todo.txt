Dirty items in Remoting
- Not possible to send from a remoting call... so called remoting loops
-- Basically a remote call is triggered from a remote call. The channel will be locked. 

- The only thing which can change a GUI is the thread which created it. Solution: 
 
public delegate void DelegateAddMessage(string nick, string msg);
Form1.Invoke(new DelegateAddMessage(Form1.AddMsg), new Object[] { nick, msg });
